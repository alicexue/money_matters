Data: Trustworthiness of Statements by 2016 Presidential Candidates. Statements are evaluated by Politifact as True, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire.

Working Idea: Use stacked bar chart to display the data. User first identifies what bar each candidate corresponds to. Then the chart transitions so that each bar is correctly labeled with its respective candidate.
